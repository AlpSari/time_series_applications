# Anomaly Detection for Time Series

Anomaly detection for time series involves identifying data points, events, or observations that deviate significantly from the expected pattern of the data over time. These anomalies can indicate critical incidents, such as system failures, fraud, or other unusual activities.

## Application

Refer to each notebook for different approaches to detect anomalies in time series.


## Data

To study anomaly detection, real-life data from the [NAB dataset][nab] is used.

[nab]:(https://github.com/numenta/NAB).

The specific data used in this folder is from the `realAdExchange/exchange-3_cpc_results` file. This dataset contains timestamped values representing the cost-per-click (CPC) results over a period of time. The dataset includes:

- `timestamp`: The date and time of the recorded value.
- `value`: The CPC value recorded at the corresponding timestamp.
