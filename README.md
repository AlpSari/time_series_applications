# Time series applications

This repository showcases various applications of time series analysis, with
examples focusing on different use cases.

## Motivation

Time series data, common in fields like finance and healthcare, are more
challenging to analyze than static data due to temporal dependencies and dynamic
patterns. Unlike fixed features, time series introduce trends, seasonality, and
correlations, complicating the application of standard machine learning and deep
learning models.

Aim of this repository is to create a beginner-friendly resources when using
time series data for analysis.

## Repository structure

Different time series applications are foldered by the categories. Navigate into
a folder of interest and follow instructions in the individual `README` files.

Currently, it includes two areas of focus:

- [Digital Signal Processing](./digital_signal_processing/README.md): Techniques
  to process and analyze time series signals.
- [Anomaly Detection](./anomaly_detection/README.md): Methods to detect anomalies in time series data.
